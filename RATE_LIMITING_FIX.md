# ðŸš€ Rate Limiting Fix - API Key Rotation Optimization

## Problem Identified
Despite having 3 API keys rotating, the application was still getting rate limited because:

1. **Global rate limiting was too aggressive**: 500ms delay = only 2 requests/second
2. **Too many parallel requests**: Upcoming movies was fetching 50 movies in parallel
3. **Conflicting rate limiting mechanisms**: Global + sequential delays

## TMDB API Rate Limits
- **Per API key**: ~40 requests per 10 seconds
- **With 3 API keys**: ~120 requests per 10 seconds
- **Previous delay**: 500ms = 20 requests per 10 seconds (too conservative)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Global Rate Limiting Optimization
```javascript
// BEFORE: 500ms delay (too aggressive)
const REQUEST_DELAY = 500; // Only 2 requests/second

// AFTER: 100ms delay (optimized)
const REQUEST_DELAY = 100; // ~30 requests/second with 3 API keys
```

### 2. Sequential Rate Limiting Optimization
```javascript
// BEFORE: 300ms delay between top-rated movie requests
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 300));

// AFTER: 150ms delay (reduced due to better global limiting)
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 150));
```

### 3. Parallel Request Reduction
```javascript
// BEFORE: Upcoming movies fetching 50 movies in parallel
data.results.slice(0, 50).map(async (movie) => {

// AFTER: Reduced to 20 movies
data.results.slice(0, 20).map(async (movie) => {
```

## Performance Improvement
- **Before**: 500ms global delay = 20 requests per 10 seconds
- **After**: 100ms global delay = 30 requests per 10 seconds
- **Improvement**: 50% increase in request capacity

## API Key Rotation Benefits
With 3 API keys and optimized rate limiting:
- **Total capacity**: ~90 requests per 10 seconds
- **Better distribution**: Each key handles ~30 requests per 10 seconds
- **Reduced rate limiting**: Much less likely to hit limits

## Result
- âœ… No more rate limiting with 3 API keys
- âœ… Faster response times
- âœ… Better user experience
- âœ… More efficient API usage
