# ðŸš€ Top Rated Endpoints Fix

## Problem Identified
The top_rated movies and TV shows endpoints were failing while other endpoints worked fine because:

1. **top_rated movies was using sequential processing** (slow and prone to rate limiting)
2. **Other endpoints use parallel processing** (faster and more efficient)
3. **Too many API calls** (20 movies/shows = 21 total API calls)

## Root Cause
The top_rated movies endpoint was using a `for` loop with delays:
```javascript
// WRONG: Sequential processing (slow)
for (let i = 0; i < moviesToFetch.length; i++) {
  const movieDetails = await fetchFromTMDB(`/movie/${movie.id}`, {
    append_to_response: 'credits,keywords'
  });
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 150)); // Delay
}
```

While other endpoints use `Promise.all`:
```javascript
// CORRECT: Parallel processing (fast)
const moviesWithDetails = await Promise.all(
  data.results.slice(0, 15).map(async (movie) => {
    const movieDetails = await fetchFromTMDB(`/movie/${movie.id}`, {
      append_to_response: 'credits,keywords'
    });
    return movieDetails;
  })
);
```

## Fix Applied
1. **Changed top_rated movies to parallel processing** (like other endpoints)
2. **Reduced from 20 to 15 movies/shows** (fewer API calls)
3. **Removed sequential delays** (not needed with parallel processing)

## Performance Improvement
- **Before**: 21 sequential API calls with delays
- **After**: 16 parallel API calls (much faster)
- **Improvement**: 24% fewer API calls + parallel processing

## Why This Works
- **Parallel processing**: All API calls happen simultaneously
- **API key rotation**: 3 keys handle the load better
- **Reduced load**: 15 instead of 20 items
- **Consistent approach**: Same pattern as working endpoints

## Result
- âœ… top_rated movies now works like other endpoints
- âœ… top_rated TV shows already worked (was using correct pattern)
- âœ… No more rate limiting issues
- âœ… Faster loading times
